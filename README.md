# [**Project 1: Classification of User Comments on YouTube**] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00380/)
This is a project that I did by following the tutorial from the instructor during my learning of Naive Bayes classification.

* Algorithms used: Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes Classifier. 
* MultinomialNB is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where it analyse categorical text data.
* In this project, the model classified the comments as ham or spam based on the probability of each tag (ham or spam).
* Naive bayes perform well in categorical data.
